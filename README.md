## Assignments for Operating Systems Course at IIITD

1) All assignments have .md and .pdf READMEs inside their folder as well as the Assignment Questions
2) Artix Linux (Non GUI Version) was used and hence the diff patch files are suited for it
3) The diff Patches have been generated by extracting 2 fresh copies of the tar file and changing the required files in one of them and then using git diff command so it does not reflect the compiled files
